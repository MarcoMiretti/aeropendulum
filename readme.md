# Aeropendulum [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarcoMiretti/aeropendulum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarcoMiretti/aeropendulum)
This propeller driven pendulum was submitted as the final project of the subject Control Systems (UTN San Francisco, CÃ³rdoba). The device is designed to track some reference angle as well also to reject disturbances. 

The main goal of this project is to use it as a hands on didactic tool, where diverse control techniques can be implemented.

## Features
Currently the device has:
* One drone propeller (with motor driver) as control actuator.
* A rotary encoder to sense the output angle.
* Bluetooth communication with PC or smartphone.
* Modest PC(console) script to interact with the device throught bluetooth.

## Planned features
* Acceleration sensor and gyroscope.
* PC(console) application to interact with the device.

## Building materials
* Drone propeller with motor and driver.
* Motor power source.
* STM32F4 Discovery board.
* HB01 UART-Bluetooth dongle.
* Rotary encoder with sensor (can be taken out of a printer).
* 6cm x 36 cm (2mm width) metal sheet for the tower (see blueprints under mechanical/).
* Heavy base.
* Rectangular aluminium 50cm x 1.05cm x 1.05cm rod for the pendulum.
* Iron (8 mm diameter) 10 cm rod for the axis.
* 3D printed parts (see desings under mechanical/).
* Screws and cables.
